I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period
I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street
and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer; a gangster for capitalism. I helped
make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I
helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to
collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American
republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the
International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902â€“1912. I brought light
to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped
make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in
1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking
back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do
was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.
